                We started off with a quick drive to the venture retreat center: https://www.ventureretreat.org
                
                Some info about Venture Retreat:
                       1. Pricing was relatively well-off, around $1k per night for 30+.
                       2. You basically live in huts (if you see on the website). Worth it for the experience.
                       3. There's a pool advertised as well: you won't be able to swim most likely from Oct. - March because of the cold.
                
                The car ride was super fun. The road is extremely windy close to the home though, so be careful!

                We made a quick beach stop at San Gregorio State Beach. We honestly were supposed to get to the retreat center on time,
                but thankfully we stopped.
                
                Truly just something out of a movie.
